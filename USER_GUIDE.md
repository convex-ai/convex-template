# User guide

This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to use convex to create a website.

## 1. Prepare ideas.

   Bad idea (an overly abstract idea; AI might be too arbitrary, resulting in something not in line with expectations)

   ```
   todos app
   ```

   Good idea (helps AI better understand what you want)

   ```
   todos app, I can create/list/update todo
   ```

## 2. Choose a seed app

   > Seed app means starter templates. All convex projects are developed based on the seed app.

   We have prepared 3 versions of the seed app

  -[NextJS 13 with app router](https://github.com/convex-ai/convex-template)

    Full functionality, integrated with documentation, testing, etc.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è But limited by the openai model, NextJS 13 was released in the past few months, and GPT's training is not very comprehensive, so there is a high probability that manual intervention is needed.

- [NextJS 13 with page router](https://github.com/convex-ai/convex-template-backup)

    The initial MVP version, without integrated documentation.

    High generation stability.

- [Next13 + TiDB Data Service](https://github.com/convex-ai/convex-template/tree/tidb-service)

## 3. Deploy the seed app

1. Click the Vercel button
2. Choose a git repo name
3. Use tidb Vercel integration

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **framework select Prisma**

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited by tidb Vercel integration. You can only bind table:test. The relevant tidb engineer has been contacted to improve this part.

4. You can verify the completion of deployment through the link in Vercel

## 4. Run locally

   ```bash
   git clone ${your_project}
   cd ${your_project}
   pnpm install # npm install also works, but we strongly suggest pnpm

   export OPENAI_API_KEY="...."

   # -v will display more running information
   # --story The story mode will be more explanatory and interesting.
   # However, a local browser connection is required to continue using convex.
   # If it hangs for an extended period, please delete that parameter and try again.
   convex run -v --story
   ```

## 5. Run locally

   ```bash
#  Your need env DATABASE_URL in local.
#  You can get it by `vercel env pull`
#  or you can found it in vercel your project setting page. Environment Section.
   cp .env.example .env

   npm run postinstall
   npm run migration
   npm run dev
   ```

## 6. Deploy

   Just need to git push the changes, Vercel will automatically detect the changes and deploy.

Finally, the core of this project is to validate how to engineer and create a multi-modal MVP, compromising on how to generate code more stably with less manual intervention. Since the code generated by OpenAI has randomness and uncertainty, if the code generated does not meet expectations, please have it regenerated üôÇ.
